    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">The dynamic vision sensors or event-cameras are bio-inspired vision platforms with independent and asynchronous pixels. Its unique design enables a number of advantages over traditional RGB cameras including high temporal resolution for capturing high speed motion without blur and high dynamic range for sensing under challenging lighting conditions. As the outputs of the event-cameras are discrete and asynchronous events, termed as event-stream, rather than high-quality video frames, they are regarded as low privacy-intrusive. However, the research on reconstruction from events has revealed that the event-streams can be converted to high quality video frames by sophisticated reconstruction algorithms, so that the claim on privacy-preserving does not hold anymore. In this paper, we focus on the privacy issue of event-streams used in EV-based classification tasks and propose, EV-Perturb, an event-stream perturbation mechanism to protect event-streams from reconstruction attacks. EV-Perturb flips polarities of events in a random manner and the theoretical proof shows it provides differential-private guarantee on the perturbed event-streams. We also evaluate the utility (classification accuracy) and privacy (video reconstruction error) of EV-Perturb on EV-based classification tasks with multiple publicly available datasets using deep learning models. Both the quantitative and qualitative results show that EV-Perturb is able to deteriorate the quality of the reconstructed frames effectively, while the machine learning models can still achieve comparable classification accuracy with heavily perturbed event-streams.</p>
