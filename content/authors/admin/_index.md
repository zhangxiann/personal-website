My name is Xian Zhang. I am a master student at [Harbin Engineering University](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/) (HEU) with a major in Software Engineering.  I am fortunate to be supervised by Dr. [Yiran Shen](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=793NrmoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), who taught me how to do research and write papers. I will finish my graduate study in June 2022. 

Prior to HEU,  I received the B.Eng degree in Software Engineering from Nanchang University. During that period, I learned a lot of basic knowledge about computer science and cultivated my interest in it.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Intenet of Things, and event stream. Currently, I am focusing on event-based vision.
